hey there azzy and iolite. i'm writing this here to tell you what you need to install to get this project running
1) the JDK 8 files. (https://adoptopenjdk.net/ and download/install jdk 8.whatever)
2) the latest version of minecraft forge (https://files.minecraftforge.net/ and click on installer)

in addition, you should get the eclipse IDE, notepad++, and desktop git. i can help you with these

once you have everything set up, open the command line in the folder you've cloned the files to and run |gradlew runClient|. that should automatically download and install the other files you need (most importantly, minecraft)
